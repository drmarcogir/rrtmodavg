# rrtmodavg
*Marco Girardello* (marco.girardello@gmail.com) 

An R package for model selection and multi-model inference for Randomized Response Logistic Regression 
Models. The package includes functions for model selection and model-averaging for RRlog models from the RRreg package.

The package can be installed by typing:

```r
# the devtools package is needed to be able to load the package
# install.packages("devtools")
library(devtools)
install_github("marcog77/rrtmodavg")
library(rrtmodavg)
``` 

# Example usage
What follows is some simple examples of how this package can be used to analyse data collected using a randomized response design. 

## Required Packages

```{r packages, message=FALSE}
library(RRreg);library(rrtmodavg)
```

## Automated model selection
The function `modtable()` generates all possible model combinations and ranks the models using the AIC or BIC.
The function can optionally generate specific model combinations e.g. models containing all 
3-variable combinations, 4-variable combinations etc.
