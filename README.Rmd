# rrtmodavg
*Marco Girardello* (marco.girardello@gmail.com) 

An R package for model selection and multi-model inference for Randomized Response Logistic Regression 
Models. The package includes functions for model selection and model-averaging for RRlog models, computed using 
the RRreg package.

The package can be installed by typing:

```r
# the devtools package is needed to be able to load the package
# install.packages("devtools")
library(devtools)
install_github("marcog77/rrtmodavg")
library(rrtmodavg)
``` 

# Example usage
What follows is some simple examples of how this package can be used to analyse data collected using a randomized response design. 

## Required Packages

```{r packages, message=FALSE}
library(RRreg);library(rrtmodavg)
library(gtools);library(MuMIn)
library(tidyr);library(dplyr)
```

## Automated model selection
The function `modtable()` generates all possible model combinations and ranks the models using the AIC or BIC.
The function can optionally generate specific model combinations e.g. models containing all 
3-variable combinations, 4-variable combinations etc. 

```r
#' @ y = character vector specifying the name of column containing data for the response variable (binary) 
#' @ x = character vector specifying column names containing data for the predictor variables
#' @ df =dataframe name containing predictor and response variables
#' @ combos = integer specifying desired variable combinations. e.g. 3 for models containing
#' @ all 3-variable combinations. For all possible model combinations specify "all".

# fit all model combinations to a dummy dataset
modtab<- modtable(y = "response", x = c("pred1","pred2","pred3","pred4"),df=dummy, combos ="all")

# print first six rows of results
head(modtab)

## Model averaging based on an information criterion
The function `modavgrrt()` performs model averaging following the methods proposed by
Burnham & Anderson (2003). Model averaging is performed on the 95% confidence set of models. 
A 95% confidence set of models selected by starting with the model displaying the 
highest weight (Akaike or BIC weight)
and adding to the model with the next highest weight until the cumulative sum of weights exceeds 0.95

by starting with the 
models with the highest weight (Akaike or BIC weight) and adding to the model with the
next highest weight until the cumulative sum of weights exceeds 0.95.

```r
#' @ intable = model selection table calculated with the function modtable
#' @ index = information criterion to be used i.e. AIC or BIC

# perform model averaging
modavgres<-modavgrrt(intable=modtab,index="BIC")

# print results
head(modavgres)

## Relative importance of predictors

The function `imprrt()` calculates variable importance following the methods developed
by Burnham & Anderson (2003) and Cade (2015). First a 95% confidence set of models is constructed. 
This is achieved by summing the model weights from the largest to the smallest until the sum is 0.95.
Variable importance is then calculated as the sum of the model weights over all models including the
explanatory variable (Burnham & Anderson 2003) or as the average of the ratio of absolute values of the t statistic  over all 
models including the explanatory variable for unstandardized predictors, weighted by 
Akaike or BIC weights (Cade 2015).


Sum of ‘Akaike weights’ over all models including the explanatory variable.

```r
#' @ intable = model selection table calculated with the function modtable
#' @ index = information criterion to be used i.e. AIC or BIC
#' @ method = "burand" to use Burnham & Anderson's method or "cade" to use Cade's method

# calculate relative importance of predictors
impres<-imprrt(intable=modtab,index="BIC",method="cade")

# print results
head(impres)
    var        imp
1   pred4 1.00000000
2   pred3 0.03710603
3   pred2 0.58083567
4   pred1 0.47866592

```


## Compute model-averaged fitted values
The function `predrrt()` calculates model-averaged fitted values Firsta a 95% confidence set of models selected by starting with the models with the highest weight (Akaike or BIC weight) and adding to the model with the next highest weight until the cumulative sum of weights exceeds 0.95. Fitted are the weighted average of the fitted values of all the models across the confidence set, where weights are Aikaike or BIC weights. 



```r
#' @ intable = model selection table calculated with the function modtable
#' @ index = information criterion to be used i.e. AIC or BIC

# calculate model-averaged fitted values
fitres<-predrrt(intable=modtab,index="BIC")

# print the first six values
head(fitres)
[1] 0.3674067 0.2862663 0.2492794 0.1649464 0.2559161 0.2531186
